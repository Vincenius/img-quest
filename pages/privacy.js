      I try to keep this website as privacy friendly as possible.
      I am using a self hosted version of <a href="https://umami.is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">umami</a> for the only purpose of knowing how many people are visiting this website.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>If you enable "Do Not Track" in your browser I won't track you</b>.
      Also AdBlockers will work for blocking the tracking. I'd recomment <i>uBlock Origin</i> for that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other than that there is nothing that could track you, as far as I'm aware of. No share links (eg. facebook),
      no cookies and no other tools.
